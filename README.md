# Progression System

The goal of this project is to implement a simple progression system to live an experience patch by patch of the expansions Classic, TBC, WoTLK.

### Tuning

Optionally, considering that we are running this progression on WoTLK, it is possible to improve different progressions cases to make them challenging the Classic/TBC environments even with a WoTLK background.

### Modules needed:
